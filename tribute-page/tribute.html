      <h3>Here’s a brief timeline of Ada Lovelace’s life and legacy:</h3>
      <div id="tribute-info" class="text-container">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1815:</strong> Born Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, in London, England. She is the daughter of the poet Lord Byron and his wife, Annabella Milbanke.</li>
          <li><strong>1816:</strong> Her parents separate, and Ada is raised by her mother, Annabella, who encourages her education in mathematics and science to quell any fears about inheriting her father's insanity.</li>
          <li><strong>1833:</strong> She meets Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor, at a party, and becomes fascinated with his work on the <i>Analytical Engine</i>, an early mechanical computer.</li>
          <li><strong>1835:</strong> Ada marries William King. As he becomes Earl of Lovelace, takes on the title of Countess.</li>
          <li><strong>1838:</strong> She publishes her first major work, a translation of an article by Italian mathematician Luigi Federico Menabrea on Babbage’s Analytical Engine. Her notes include what is now considered the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, earning her the title of the first computer programmer.</li>
          <li><strong>1843:</strong> Her translation and notes on the Analytical Engine are published, significantly advancing the understanding of computing principles.</li>
          <li><strong>1844:</strong> Ada’s health begins to decline. She suffers from a series of illnesses, including a suspected case of cancer.</li>
          <li><strong>1852:</strong> Ada Lovelace dies on November 27, at the age of 36.</li>
          <li><strong>1855:</strong> Posthumously, her contributions to computing are recognized, but it takes many years for her work to gain wider acknowledgment.</li>
          <li><strong>1953:</strong> Ada Lovelace is officially recognized for her pioneering work in computer science when her contributions are celebrated in various retrospectives and academic studies.</li>
